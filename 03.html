  <em>“Always so cautious, child. Look before you leap. It’s a good quality, and will make for a fitting name. Just don’t let your caution become the kind of fear that rules you.”</em>
<br><br>
They were dead. All of them were dead.
<br><br>
She wondered if it was her fault, curled under the bed, the ash-stained pool of blood creeping toward her snout as she watched, frozen. They’d all known it was coming, but how do you prepare for the end of the world? 
<br><br>
They had tried, she knew that. All of them had tried except for her, sitting frozen, watching the way that the hands of the clock moved (her mother had loved it, that facade of the analogue, that romanticization of simpler things pulling her out into the countryside and away from the factories, the asphalt, the smog. Away from the bombs, but not far enough). Nobody had blamed her, nobody had yelled. They had just told her to hide as the daylight drew to a close. She and her brother, both— That foolish, reckless, headstrong child. She had never loved anyone more, would never love anyone as much as she had loved him.
<br><br>
His eyes were glassy, empty. She kept hoping he’d blink, breathe, <em>anything</em>, but he was so, so still.
<br><br>
He could never hold still. It was why he bolted. Where fear froze her, it moved him, and he ran. Her parents had urged her to stay, stay, stay, and she cursed herself for listening. If she had run after him, maybe they would all be alive. If she had run, maybe they all would have died, and she wouldn’t be watching her brother for signs that he wasn’t…
<br><br>
His blood crept toward her across the faux-wooden floorboards. She reached out a shaky hand, placing it delicately against the scarlet. It ran cold against her scales.

It did not take long for her to realize that her thin pajamas would not be enough.
<br><br>
There was not a clear divide between when fear left and instinct took its place. But she had always been a planner, calculating and sharp. She could list out all of her fears, and then give you half a dozen escape plan for each one. Everything was gone, everyone was dead, and she was numb. But that numbness created a void that practicality was all too eager to fill.
<br><br>
It was easier to let her survival instincts drive.
<br><br>
It was cold, and only getting colder. JDHP-4 only ever just barely dropped down into the negative degrees, and it had already surpassed anything she had known in her sixteen years of life. It took her a few moments to understand her surroundings. Her home was a skeleton of itself, wooden struts reaching like ribs into the dark sky.There had been a fire burning in the hearth, but it was only embers now, smothered by the thick layer of ash that had blown in with the detonations. This was the main room, then, where her parents had set up their too-small bed so that she and her brother would stop bickering over having to share a room.
<br><br>
Loss threatened to worm its way in through the gaps in her armor. She shuddered, shaking it off. Grief was a luxury, and she would allow herself to indulge in it only once she survived. She turned slowly, searching for..the doorway, there. To its left was what remained of a coat closet, harboring too-thin jackets and boots with the treads worn down by gravel and overuse. She dug through the rubble, finding her own and pulling them on, unsure of whether or not she should be concerned by the fact that she wasn’t shivering.  Her mother’s coat was next, then her father’s.
<br><br>
Finally, she held her brother’s, and something seemed caught in her throat. It was too small, but she could still feel the biting wind.
<br><br>
But it was so small.
<br><br>
She turned her head, looking for something to… There. A nail stuck out from what was left of the doorframe. She held the jacket to it, steeled herself. Then pushed it forward and pulled down, tearing through the fabric and allowing it to come apart in two pieces. She repeated the process until she was left with a ragged pile of fabric, which she shoved into her sleeves and wrapped around her hands. One small piece—blue, she remembered when he got the jacket, how excited he was, it was his favourite—she tucked into her pocket. And these are the parts of him that she carried with her through the fields of dead, empty nothing where green used to be: a piece of his jacket, his blood on her hand.

<br><br>
Her feet had stopped hurting a long time ago.
<br><br>
This was bad. She knew it was bad, but it was also a small relief. She was so tired, and if she didn’t make it, if this meant that it was almost over, then damn it at least she could say that she <em>tried</em>. Not when it mattered. But now, at least.
<br><br>
She had hoped to find someone. Anyone. But maybe she was the last one alive, maybe nobody else on this planet is left to find her. Her breath started to hitch, and she felt the way her pulse fluttered. It was giving up. She was giving up.
<br><br>
She just wanted to rest.
<br><br>
She slumped forward, knees gently indenting the grey powder on the ground. She lacked to energy to even lie down, her eyes sliding shut and the air in her lungs leaving her body with a weary rattle.
<br><br>
For a moment, she saw the sun streaming through her eyelids. She smiled. But it was wrong, wasn’t it? It didn’t usually…flicker like…
<br><br>
Her eyes opened, and she found herself staring into a fire. Sheets of paper curled, brightly coloured covers collapsing in on themselves as flame ate them away to black.
<br><br>
“Holy shit.” The voice gurgled slightly, sounding as if it came from within the fire itself. Looks found herself once again lying curled up on her side, but this time she was surrounded not by debris and death but by…
<br><br>
Her eyes skimmed the stacks around her, then slid back to the fire. “Are those…,” she rasped. “...books?”
<br><br>
“No other choice,” said the fire. Looks pushed herself up ever so slightly, thawing joints protesting as she did. Past the flame, she saw a grey-green figure, featureless but still somehow forlorn.
<br><br>
“Parker,” it said, the amorphous fluid of its face shifting to create a slight smile.
<br><br>
“Looks,” Looks replied, too tired for caution now.
<br><br>
Parker nodded. “Welcome back, Looks. Glad to have another survivor.”
<br><br>
“How many have you…?” Looks couldn’t quite bring herself to finish the question, but Parker answered anyways.
<br><br>
“Just us, for now,” she said. “Only us.”

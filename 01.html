  The air that followed Keerava-Demeepa into the building was cold. There was no novelty to that, though. It was always cold here.
<br><br>
The smell of oil mingled with the scent of a soldering iron, and a diverse array of metal and wire carnage was strewn across tables and benches. The workshop was clearly made to house many more workers, but the vast majority of the mechanically-inclined population had been recruited for work in orbit. The reception area was boarded off, forcing patrons to enter via a side door, its bright red <em>EMPLOYEES ONLY</em> demarcation abandoned halfway through an attempt to remove it.  
<br><br>
“You made it.” The words, despite sounding slightly like they were being spoken underwater, carried a dry tone. “Was worried I’d have to call someone to chip you out of a snowbank.” A grey-green slime poked her head out from behind a tangle of metal that the reptilian guessed had been a borg, once, abandoned when its brain had fried. They all did, eventually. 
<br><br>
“Didn’t freeze, no, but not for lack of trying.”
<br><br>
The slime—Parker—let out a gurgly “Hmmm.” She ushered it over to the far corner of the shop, and it picked carefully around jagged edges that she simply let pass through her gelatinous form. While the safety of her fleshier patrons may have been in question, it wasn’t as if she was totally careless: They arrived at a small set of folding chairs next to a well-maintained space heater, which she turned on and cranked up to its maximum setting. “You fry your temp regulators again, Keev?”
<br><br>
Keerava sighed. “Not my fault they have to run constantly, is it?” It retorted.
<br><br>
“So, yes?”
<br><br>
“...Yes.”
<br><br>
Parker waved a hand towards a small, curtained-off section of the room just behind them. “Get changed, then. Depending what you did to ‘em, you might not get ‘em back today, though. You pack enough for an overnight?” She chuckled as its eyes slid to the duffle it had carried in, its ear twitching in what she surmised was frustration. “That’s a yes, then. You should’ve expected it. Less and less repts means less and less demand for heat threading. Parts are harder to come by. I’m gonna have to improvise.”
<br><br>
“I didn’t say anything.”
<br><br>
“Not out loud, no. But you really need to get all that under control.”
<br><br>
“All <em>what</em>, Parker?”
<br><br>
She made a sweeping gesture. Without facial features, slimes were very dependent on movement to convey meaning. But hers was conscious, at least. “The ears, the tail. You’re an open book.”
<br><br>
Keerava snorted. “To you, maybe. But you’re the person every reptilian comes to. Who else is gonna clock it? The <em>humans</em>?”
<br><br>
“The older generation, maybe. The ones who had pets. Before….” She sighed. “Well, you know. This is depressing. Go strip, give me something to work on so I stop thinking about things.” Keerava bobbed its head, feeling somewhat apologetic, but knowing better than to press the issue. It ducked behind the curtain, shedding its abundance of layers until it reached its thermal-threaded heatsuit. The Long Winter (it hated the name, it suggested impermanence, an optimistic ideal doomed to a slow and painful death) had created a surge in demand for them that had dropped off as its people had started to leave the planet. It wasn’t that the other races didn’t benefit from them, but the warmbloods could survive the steady thirty to forty below zero without having to run them at maximum output levels constantly. They had become a luxury for most, an unnecessary expense, and people here didn’t do unnecessary expenses. The planet was being bled dry, had arguably been dry for quite some time now. Those remaining were just particularly deluded maggots assuming that the desiccated corpse they fed upon would never be eaten away in full. 
<br><br>
When it emerged, shivering slightly under a sweater and loose pants, it noticed a steaming kettle and mug of tea on a small side table, alongside a small selection of books. It allowed itself a small smile. The small argument was water under the bridge, evidently, as most of their arguments were. A small population was a tight-knit one, and if you were the kind of person who couldn’t move past the occasional spat, you would find yourself rather out of interpersonal connections. Such things were a valuable commodity, as demonstrated by Parker’s staunch refusal to allow Keerava to proffer the meagre contents of its wallet alongside its heatsuit. “You’ll just owe me one,” she said.
<br><br>
“I think I owe you too many, at this point,” it replied. She gurgled in reply.
<br><br>
“You were eyeing up that new temp agency, weren’t you? Treat me to a nice dinner when they inevitably recognize your many and varied talents and give you all the high-paying, important jobs.” 
<br><br>
Rolling its eyes, Keerava said, “Sure, when they discover my preternatural ability to stress over anything and everything, I’m certain they’ll find a way to put it to use fuelling the entire power grid with harnessed nervous energy.”
<br><br>
“That’s the spirit. Now go away and let me do my job.”
<br><br>
Keerava chuckled, making its way back over to the radiator. It picked up its mug of tea, kept warm with a heated cup holder, and took a sip. It was fruity, and slightly floral. Keerava hadn’t bothered checking the teabag first, as it knew that Parker would have been careful to select something tannin-free (one of the few—very few—benefits of a society entirely overseen by galaxy-spanning megacorps was that their dietary warning labels were extremely thorough). It skimmed the stack of books, selecting one that piqued its interest before sorting through its bag to retrieve the one it had borrowed on its last visit. Placing it carefully atop the pile, it settled in to start reading.
<br><br>
Books had always been one of its great loves. However, they were another one of those infamous “unnecessary expenses,” which made new reading material hard to come by. Its small library at home had been read to the point of missing covers and broken spines, and it had largely given up on its hopes of expanding it. Until it met Parker, its radiator having given out on a freezing “summer” morning per the planetary calendar. It had attempted to take it down to its regular mechanic for repairs, but found the door firmly locked. A glossy CyberSun recruitment poster had been plastered onto its surface, but it was the hastily-scrawled address written in marker upon the metal itself that caught Keerava’s attention: <em>Parker Laux, Mechanic. Just south of the old Arc Research Facility. Open for business!</em>
<br><br>
Keerava had hauled the heater in a wagon-turned-sledge, teeth gritted against the cold, until it found the small building tucked into the shadow of the facility’s steadily decomposing structure. Parker had been brusque, though that had never really changed, just warmed slightly. She only really and truly opened up when she saw the book that it had been reading. She had approached the same corner it sat in now, halfway through rattling off a list of rates and payment options. She stopped short, interjecting with a simple “—Or you can just give me that.” Despite its limited finances, Keerava had been reluctant to give up one of its few remaining books, but she had been <em>insistent</em>. She had finally appeased it by agreeing to loan it books from her own collection, contingent on a few rules: It brought them back in good condition, she would be its only mechanic, and she would accept money going forward (she didn’t usually let it pay her, despite this, but she wasn’t willing to bleed it of its collection, either). Thus had begun their routine. It brought all its repairs to her (they were frequent, the corpos didn’t build anything to last, but they also weren’t exactly lavishing a dying planet with shipments), and would leave her past loans or copies from its own collection. Parker’s library, while not growing particularly quickly, was growing nonetheless. She was one of the few people here who would deal in barter, with most of the planet’s inhabitants being desperate to secure enough funds for a shuttle anywhere else, so those with empty wallets but full bookshelves came to her. For reasons entirely unknown to Keerava, she was determined to stay.
<br><br>

<br><br>
Despite the chaos of the workshop, Parker’s kitchen was tremendously well-organised. This was Keerava’s doing. Repairs brought it here once or twice a month, and it tried to pay her back through effort if nothing else. She was not particularly good at feeding herself, it had realised, preferring bland and unappealing “survival food” to anything nutritious or, heaven forbid, <em>palatable</em>. This despite having a huge array of flavour receptors, it had noted, chastising her for having “twice the taste buds but half the taste” even compared to the reptilian’s own limited sense. So, on those days where it had to stay in the guest room of her small home above the workshop, it made dinner.
<br><br>
Checking the status of the ARC Nutri-Grow, it clicked impatiently as the <em>“low starter”</em> light flashed. It scribbled a bold reminder on the whiteboard on the fridge, stepped back, then added two lines underneath it. While this was largely for Parker’s benefit—even fake, vat-grown meat had some real nutritional value—it was also determined not to spend some future evening sucking on a tube of reptilian-safe nutrient paste because she had forgotten to buy more for the hundredth time.
<br><br>
“One of these days, I really will make you move in.”
<br><br>
Keerava sighed. “You don’t want to put up with me twenty-four-seven, I promise. Besides— Oi,” it broke off as she moved to sit at the table. “Sink. Oil. Out.” A sound like bubbles blown through molasses emanated from somewhere inside Parker’s semisolid frame, a noise it recognized as a sigh. She made her way to a smaller, secondary basin by the door (not the kitchen sink, not this time, Keerava had scrubbed grease stains out of it last time and was not doing so again), and it politely looked away as her gelatinous flesh shifted in order to isolate and expel the grime that had begun to make a crawl from her hands and toward her elbows. “Thanks. Now, sit.”
<br><br>
She obliged, and Keerava transferred the last two slices of not-meat from the Nutri-Grow onto the dimly glowing grill. It turned, leaning back against the counter while the slabs sizzled and emitted an almost-convincing smell. Parker placed her now clean hands directly onto her plate, allowing them to morph and cover the faux-steak and hardy winter greens upon it. She had, like many slimes, made a polite attempt to use cutlery and insert food into where her mouth “should” be (according to some of the more prejudiced members of the population), but Keerava had quickly told her to give it up. It was unnecessary, for starters, and unsettling, as the movements were clearly unfamiliar and it was somewhat upsetting watching her occasionally drive a fork into her own neck.
<br><br>
Judging its own meal done, Keerava slid the steaks atop the bed of greens on its plate, carefully turning the grill off. It did not sit, electing to stand and eat instead. Parker’s table was small and ill-suited to digitigrades like itself, who required extra legroom. The room was quiet aside from the sound of it chewing, but the quiet itself was strange, as Parker usually did her best to fill it. Keerava sighed. “The sound of you thinking is ruining my dinner. Out with it.”
<br><br>
“I really do mean it, Keev. You could stay here. Living alone isn’t good for you.”
<br><br>
“And it’s good for you?”
<br><br>
“It’s <em>different</em> for me. I still have…”
<br><br>
“People.” Keerava couldn’t disguise the growl in its voice. “I get it, Parker. You still have people and I don’t. Good for you.”
<br><br>
“Look, I’m sorry, but it’s <em>true</em>. It’s harsh, but you’re in such a shell, Keev. You don’t even have a nam—”
<br><br>
“Stop. Just…” Keerava rubbed the softer scales atop its nose with a thumb and forefinger. “Yes, I’m well aware that I never had a proper naming. Family didn’t want my name to be tied to the Winter, but joke’s on them. It’s still here, and they’re not. <em>I’m</em> still here.” It resented the way its voice cracked with the last sentence. Parker stood, moving to stand beside it as it set its unfinished plate down.
<br><br>
“I overstepped,” she said.
<br><br>
“Yup.”
<br><br>
“I’m sorry.”
<br><br>
“Yup.”
<br><br>
She burbled, somewhere between frustration and remorse. “I just worry, Keev, that’s all. You’re just a kid, and you’re all alone.”
<br><br>
“I’m eighteen years old.”
<br><br>
“Great, we’re saying the same thing.”
<br><br>
Keerava’s tail thumped against the floorboards, rattling Parker’s meagre assortment of dishes in their cupboards. It let the anger wash over it for just a moment, then sagged against the countertop. “Look,” it said. “It’s not that I don’t appreciate the offer. I do, really. But you want to stay here, and I don’t. I can’t.”
<br><br>
“I can keep you patched up. I’ve done it this long, haven’t I?”
<br><br>
“You have, and I’m grateful. But we both know that that won’t last forever. Cyber doesn’t give a shit about this planet anymore. They’re only keeping us out of spite, because Nano wanted us gone and failed by a hair. We’re a symbol, ‘Oh look what CyberSun can survive, look at the way their technologies have kept those poor, poor people alive,’ but they don’t do charity. It’s been fifteen years, and there are better, bloodier martyrs to make poster children out of. They want warm bodies, Parker, and we’ve got ice. That’s it.”
<br><br>
Parker made a gesture that was likely analogous to wringing her hands, her arms meeting and twisting into each other in a harried display of emotion. “You’re right. You’re right.” Her voice softened, becoming painfully quiet. “I know that. I do. I’m sorry. But… But there’s no <em>good</em> way off this planet, Keevs.”
<br><br>
Its voice mirrored hers, weighed down with harrowing understanding. “I know.”
<br><br>
“It’s a Cyber contract, isn’t it.” Not a question, but it answered anyways.
<br><br>
“Yes.” A pause. Both of them knew what the contracts entailed. Neither wanted to say it out loud. “It’s just cleanup work. I’ll be staying on-planet, just doing facility maintenance. Worst it’ll get is sifting through debris for valuables. I’ll be fine, and then I’ll be done. Get a ticket to somewhere sunny. Maybe they’ll let me bring a plus-one, you never know.” Its attempt at humour fell hard. 
<br><br>
“I’m sure that’s what they’re telling you.” The bitterness in Parker’s tone may have been cutting, but Keerava knew that that particular barb was not meant for it. 
<br><br>
“Parker…” It was a cautious start. Testing the waters. “It’s not that I don’t believe you. Really. But I guess it would just… Help to know, well, why you know.” She went very still, and Keerava briefly (and irrationally) wondered if she was about to send it back out into the cold. But, finally, she did move, returning to the table.
<br><br>
“Sit,” she said, and despite its discomfort, it did.

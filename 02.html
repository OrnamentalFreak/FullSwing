  Books always made war out to be something loud and prolonged. A mouth pried agape, a slow tearing of every tooth ripped from its socket one by one. Screams choked to a dull wheeze clawing for freedom against a throat rubbed raw by their predecessors. Parker, old enough to remember a time before the war, had found the swiftness and silence of it to be much, much worse than anything that her books had prepared her for.
<br><br>
The warnings had appeared all at once, one morning in the early spring. She was sure that some NanoTrasen lackey up in orbit, far enough away that their planet was little more than an ant farm ready to be shaken, had gotten a good laugh at the idea of news of her impending death being broadcast via her alarm clock, her fridge, her bathroom mirror. A comedy in abstract, but in the flesh, it sent a raw terror through her. A primal fear long forgotten, a rabbit trapped in its warren by a hound, freedom eclipsed by slavering jaws and stinking breath. Across the planet, the copious electronic displays present in every home had shown the same message:
<br><br>
<span style="font-family: Lucida Console;"">[ATTENTION: All CyberSun personnel stationed on Jackstadt-Derring Habitable Planet No. 4]</span>
<br><br>
A choked laugh had escaped her, then. They weren’t <em>personnel</em>. Maybe their parents had been, or their spouses, or a friend of a friend seeking the planetary population bonus incentives. They were civilians. Not that that mattered to NanoTrasen. Not that it even mattered to CyberSun, really. They were all assets, their very existence feeding into its ever-expanding markets. Markets that had, finally, outgrown the limits that their competition had deemed acceptable.
<br><br>
<span style="font-family: Lucida Console;">[Due to violations of the CyberSun-NanoTrasen non-compete agreement, established and signed on November 8th, 2546, your planet has been deemed to be an asset existing outside the allowable bounds of CyberSun’s limitations. Therefore, all company assets on Jackstadt-Derring Habitable Planet No.4 (henceforth referred to as “the planet”), are subject to an exterminatory sweep, to take place in twenty-four hours. Assets may include, but are not limited to:</span>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-family: Lucida Console;">Technologies</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: Lucida Console;">Facilities</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: Lucida Console;">Personnel</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: Lucida Console;">Terraformed areas under CyberSun purview</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: Lucida Console;">Currency holdings both on- and off-planet, as determined by the issuing financial entity’s registered system address</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-family: Lucida Console;">We understand that this may be inconvenient or upsetting for those affected. Please rest assured that our dedicated Asset Reclamation and Termination Support Line is available to you, should you like to make a complimentary inter-system call, or leave a record of last words and final wishes. Thank you for your understanding.]</span>
<br><br>
The shipyards and docks had been the first to go, their systems frozen. Parker couldn’t truly be sure who had done it. Maybe NanoTrasen’s hack had gone farther than she thought. Maybe, in a begrudging effort to minimise collateral, CyberSun had agreed to cooperate with the extermination effort. She didn’t know, and didn’t particularly care. Many spent the day railing against the corp, as if it would make a difference, growing more and more erratic as replies failed to come. Parker didn’t bother joining the masses thrashing against the launch facilities, eventually breaking through to find them empty. Everyone worth retrieving had been taken off-world overnight. CyberSun, of course, had known that this was coming.
<br><br>
Parker, for her part, spent the day with her books. Her own frantic energy was spent moving them by the armload, then by the box, downstairs. As the sun crept across the sky—the last time she would see it, why hadn’t she stopped to look? To glance into a blue-green atmosphere one last time?—she gave up on caution entirely, simply throwing them down the stairs to land in crumpled heaps at the bottom. When darkness finally arrived, she retreated after them with what non-perishable food she had on-hand. And then she waited.
<br><br>
She was lucky. Her physiology allowed her to survive the bombs themselves, though she was unconscious for a long, long time as her body worked to force the toxins out of her bloodstream. Thankfully, the bombs now decayed quickly, the corpos not wanting the radiation to persist for so long that the planets couldn’t be reclaimed and reformed later. She had emerged from the rubble and ash to a world of plummeting temperatures and grey, choking skies. 
<br><br>
It had been so, so quiet. She hadn’t even had time to hear the blasts. And quiet it remained. 
<br><br>
She didn’t venture out until her supplies had dwindled down to nothing. The only thing worse than the idea of being the sole survivor was confirmation of it.
<br><br>
She’d thought that, hadn’t she? She wondered, in the present, if she might have been better off alone. It would have hurt less.
